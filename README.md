API: Dog CEO API-https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all

Challenges: This is the first link that was in the list of public API's about dogs. It was my bad that when I checked the JSON of that specific link, I thought it already has all the details I would need. Then I realized that it didn't and I had to try other Dog APIs, but those needed keys and I wasn't familiar how to code it in and the documentation was confusing for me. So I rechecked the first one and I found that it has a url that did have the details I needed in the JSON so I had to change just the link.
